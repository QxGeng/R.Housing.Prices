# Predictive Analytics - Housing Prices King County, WA

United States housing prices have fluctuated over the past century. Different parts of the country have gradually become more expensive to live in as a result of changes in economic conditions. 
Housing prices reflect the estimated values of homes in relation to their physical features and geographical locations.
